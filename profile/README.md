_Learn new skills by completing realistic projects in your own GitHub repository._

- :dancer: **Learning should be fun**: There are no simulations or boring tutorials here, just hands-on lessons created by GitHub and taught with GitHub Actions.
- :hammer_and_wrench: **Real projects**: Learn new skills while working in your own copy of a real project.
- :robot: **Helpful bot**: GitHub Actions provides instructions and feedback throughout your journey.
- :computer: **Real workflow**: Everything happens with real GitHub features, such as Issues, Actions, and Codespaces.
